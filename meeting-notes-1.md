# How do we define health?
Many ways to think about health of open source projects. We’re interested in both the health of the project and of the individual contributors. For some this also means finding ways to be descriptive about the health through metrics and qualitative understanding and for others it means proscriptive tools for helping projects succeed.

# Why do we care?
Multiplying efforts
Helping others understand the stability, progress, or growth of a project.

# What are best practices to set a project or contributor on a good path?
e.g. Contribution guides, codes of conduct, read, patterns
- use studies

# What are the motivations of different types of contributors?

#How do you measure health? What metrics have been used?
For people? For projects? Have heard of the following:
- stars, watching, forked
- percentage of paid versus volunteer contributors
- impact on developers (# of forked projects,
- impact on end-users (# of people
- sustainability
- test coverage
- positive change and churn
- (open source in spirit but not in practice)
- software health versus open source health
- burnout

#What are the different types and lifecycles of projects?
Shifting from internal engineering to community.
"Benevolent dictators for life" to committee?

#How can we make this data and tools open as well?
